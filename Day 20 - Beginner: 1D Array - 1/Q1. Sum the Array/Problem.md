Problem Name: Q1. Sum the Array

## Problem Description

Write a program to print sum of elements of the input array A of size N.

Note: User is supposed to write a program from scratch to add the elements of the input array and print the result.

Note for Python learners: You don't need to write code for taking input. The input is already provided to you as function parameter.

## Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000

1 <= A <= 1000

## Input Format

array A of size N.

Note: User is supposed to write a program from scratch to add the elements of the input array and print the result.

Note for Python learners: You don't need to write code for taking input. The input is already provided to you as function parameter.

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000

1 <= A <= 1000

Input Format

- The first integer N denotes the number of integers in the array.
- The next N integers denotes the element of the array A.

## Output Format

A single integer containing sum of elements from the input array.

## Example Input

Input 1:
Input 2:
4 10 50 40 80

## Example Output

Output 1:
15
Output 2:
180

Example Explanation

Input-1:
N = 5 , A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
here the first integer is the size of A and the remaining elements are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
which all sum to 15
Input-2:
N = 4 , A = [10, 50, 40, 80]
here the first integer is the size of A and the remaining elements are [10, 50, 40, 80]
which all sum to 180
