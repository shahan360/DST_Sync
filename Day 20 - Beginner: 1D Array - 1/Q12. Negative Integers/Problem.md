Problem Name: Q12. Negative Integers

## Problem Description

Write a program to print all negative numbers from input array A of size N. Take integer N and N elements of the array as input from user.

## Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000
-1000 <= A <= 1000

## Input Format

array A of size N. Take integer N and N elements of the array as input from user.

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000
-1000 <= A <= 1000

Input Format

A single line representing N followed by N integers of the array A

## Output Format

A single line containing elements from the input array which are negative in the same order.
Note: Keep a space character (' ') at the end of the line.

## Example Input

Input 1:
5 1 -5 2 -8 -4
Input 2:
4 -1 0 -8 -1

## Example Output

Output 1:
-5 -8 -4
Output 2:
-1 -8 -1

Example explanation:
Output 1:
all the negative elements of [5 1 -5 2 -8 -4] are [-5 -8 -4]
Output 2:
all the negative elements of [4 -1 0 -8 -1] are [-1 -8 -1]

Note:

This question requires you to read a list of integers from input and convert them using the map() function.
Since this concept will be covered later in the module, we encourage you to do some independent research and write your code accordingly.
