Problem Name: Q7. Right Shift an Array

## Problem Description

Write a program that reads an integer array A from input and modifies the array by shifting each element to the right by one position and by shifting the last element to the first position. After performing the shifting operation, print the modified array.
**Note:** Ensure there is a space character (' ') at the end of the line.

## Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105 1 <= A[i] <= 109

## Input Format

and modifies the array by shifting each element to the right by one position and by shifting the last element to the first position. After performing the shifting operation, print the modified array.
**Note:** Ensure there is a space character (' ') at the end of the line.

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105 1 <= A[i] <= 109

Input Format

The first line of the input is the size of the array N. The second line of the input is N integers of the array separated by space.

## Output Format

Print each element of the array, followed by a space (including the last element).

## Example Input

Input 1:
5
1 2 3 4 5
Input 2:
3
2 3 1

## Example Output

Output 1:
5 1 2 3 4
Output 2:
1 2 3
