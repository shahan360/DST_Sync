Problem Name: Q6. Check if Array is Sorted

## Problem Description

Given an array A, check if it is sorted in non-decreasing order or not.

Non-decreasing order means that the numbers in a sequence can stay the same or increase, but they cannot decrease.

## Problem Constraints

1 <= Ai <= 109
1 <= |A| <= 105

## Input Format

The first and only argument contains an integer array A.

## Output Format

## Example Input

Input 1:
A = [1, 2, 2]
Input 2:
A = [1, 2, 1]

## Example Output

Output 1:
1
Output 2:
0

Example Explanation

## Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
We can see that the array elements are in non-decreasing order.

Explanation 2:
Second element is greater than the third element thus array is not in ascending order, hence not sorted.

## Solution

See `Solution.java` for the implementation.
